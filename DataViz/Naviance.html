          <p><strong>Navient engaged in behaviors that negativly impacted their consumers, and had especially concerning behavior when it came to federal loans and servicemembers. It was found that Navient had a fair share of complaints from servicemembers across the United States, and these issues were largely tied to poor payment handeling and bad infomration in regards to their loans. It seems clear that this group was affected quite a bit, and the chart below shows the breakdown of the complaints lodged against Navient. This data favors the case against Navient that they were decpetive against groups like former servicemembers.</strong></p>

          <p><strong>The data also shows a clear trend of roughly equal occurance in claims across states in similar regions of the country and states with similar populations. It seems clear that this is an issue that affected students around the country, and notably a few Big Ten schools in these states. The main Big Ten schools in these states are University of Michigan, Illinois Univeristy, and Ohio State.</strong></p>
