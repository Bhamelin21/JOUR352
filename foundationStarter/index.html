<h3>Team History</h3>

<p>The Baltimore Orioles are a major league baseball team established in 1901, moving around the country under different names in different cities before moving to Baltimore in 1954. The team has three World Series Titles in 1966, 1970 and 1983. They most recently won their division, the AL East, in 2014 and last made the playoffs in 2016. Since then they have been one of the worst teams in baseball, losing over 100 games in three straight seasons and having four top-five draft picks in a row.

<h3>Current Outlook</h3>
<p>The team currently is in the middle of a roster rebuild through the draft and free agency, signing backups and players to fill the gaps while the prospects develop. The free agents are also meant to keep the team's talent in the minor leagues so the team can lose games and have better draft picks. Right now the team cannt finsh making any roster moves due to the lockout caused over the contract talks between the player's union and the owners. But be assured the team will likely lose over 100 games this season as well, but be on the lookout as the top two Orioles prospects have the chance to join the major league roster after a few weeks this season, assuming their is a season.</p>
